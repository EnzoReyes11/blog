# Worklog

### 10/10/25
Improved fonts and other minor changes.

#### Done:
- Added the new IBM Plex Font (normal and italic) into Tailwind. Now font-sans is IBM Plex.
- Fixed the fonts in Chips and BlogPostCard excerpt. 
- Fixed white space wrapping in About Me.
- Added backlong and Techonologies into Project.md

Now this blog also uses worklog-action to generate the content.
Started to tweak the fonts.


#### Done:
- Updating the fonts so it's easier to read. Using IBM Plex Sans except on headers and 
anchors.
- Added the Workflow Action into this repo. It's redundant, but now creating content for this 
works the same as in the other repos.

#### Work Remaining:
- More intelligent use of fonts.
  - Adding to all anchors look bad. Also
  - The chips with technologies in the frontpage look bad.
- Keep looking for a Hero image to use in the homepage.
